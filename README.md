A test app for Trade Me's API

TODO
====

* Refactor the commands so you don't have to write as much code per command.
* Support POST commands.
* Push responsibility of the mapped result into command (could the command hold the response?)
* The UI, all of it. I'm thinking something dark and moody.
* Navigation
* Caching using CoreData
